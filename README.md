Part 3:
  I chose the markup for part 3 because I wanted it to have heirarchy. I made everything first be in a playlist tag because I knew that everything we were adding would pertain to a playlist. In this playlist we were asked to add ten songs so I split up the ten songs by having each song in their own sooonog tag. Within these song tags each song needed a few characteristics like song name, artist name, album name, release date, and genres. So with this being said I made a tag for each one of those items and added them in the song tag for each song. When all was done it ended up being a heirarchy of playlist being the outside, then song, then song details no the inner most layer.
