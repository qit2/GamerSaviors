Part 1 (Ryan Qi):
  I choose to work on the part one html. In this version, I put all ten songs in a big div because all the songs should be in one playlits, then i make each song have their own div. After that I divide all the characteristics like song name, artist name, album name, release date, and genres in to two div, one for image part and the other one is for the word part. I did this in this ways because this will allow to arrage the image and word later when we work on the CSS. Also i give each characteristics their own div, which give assess to add CSS to the content sperately. 

Part 2(David Fink):
  I chose the markup for part 2 because I wanted it to have heirarchy. I made everything first be in a playlist tag because I knew that everything we were adding would pertain to a playlist. In this playlist we were asked to add ten songs so I split up the ten songs by having each song in their own song tag. Within these song tags each song needed a few characteristics like song name, artist name, album name, release date, and genres. So with this being said I made a tag for each one of those items and added them in the song tag for each song. When all was done it ended up being a heirarchy of playlist being the outside, then song, then song details in the inner most layer.
  
Part 3 (Ryan Zhou and Ryan Qi)    
  
  For this part, Ryan Qi and Ryan Zhou worked on the HTML and CSS together. Actually, we made two versions of the CSS. At the beginning, we didn't get the idea that we need to organize one song per line and make it look like a table. As the result, we made our first version as ten boxs which have their characteristics like song name, artist name, album name, release date, and genres. Each box have their own <div> tag and everything was listed incorrectly, thanks to the professor's help, we've figured out an alternative way to achieve the goal and display the information as neatly as possible. 
  
Part 4 (Eric Zhang):

  I created the CSS for part 4 based on the XML that David made. I organized everything into displaying the information in columns, but had to preserve the whitespace from the XML file itself to format the genres as a list. I also made the album covers display to the right, with all of them being set to a specific size of 250 pixels. I also made the width of each column relative to the browser size, but the album cover may cover information if the browser is not wide enough. To make sure each entry was separated, I added whitespace before every song element. I also added a light blue background to make it easier on the eyes.
