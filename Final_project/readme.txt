David Finck:

On this projct I focused on the main.php page which was the search and advanced search section of the website. I first had challenges with this because I couldn't find a large
enough database online and I also couldn't find an easy to use API. Due to this I decided to just create my own database so it would have everything I needed to make this site.
The main issue with this however is the database is really small and could not compare to the competitors sites. This made our website more of just a demo to show off what the site
can do with just a small amount of video games on it and in the future we would look to partner with a retail store that already has a large database of all of their video games.

I also ran into challenges when writing the actual code. For starters I first wrote a lot of code to make it so that all the queries would be separate quiries for each button clicked
and just be a chain of queries. I realized after getting this to work that this was actually not what the quick search should do so I had to rewrite what I already had.

Another huge issue with this page was when I clicked on a game making sure that when clicking a game it would lead to a dynamic page on the other side that changed based on what was clicked.
I could only get it t work if there was a second button that wouold change the gamepage.php and then when you click on the game it would go to that page. This however is not what we wanted
for our site so I asked Eric to help me with this section and he was able to get it working smoothly by using ajax and javascript.

I also worked on the css and html for the main.php and some of the gamepage.php.
