Eric Zhang:
I created the HTML base web page to house all of the PHP that David would be writing. I interpreted the directions as being able to add the columns through the 
page itself, so I created buttons to add columns to rows as well as create new tables. I also created an input for each part of the forms that would need to be filled
when adding students, courses, or grades. I then created another section underneath the forms where the information in the tables could be displayed.

I worked on part 3 of this lab and mainly did the index.php, main.js, gradebook.php, and styles.css pages. I worked on using php to obtain the data base and put all the information from the data base onto a
web page. I also created 3 different forms that when filled out would add directly to the database. I used javascript and css to make the data only show up when the right button was clicked.
