Since all of the operations were implemented already, I made sure that we were using polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes in our calculator.
For polymorphism, we use it in all of the operations, as both the abstract class and interface have two functions that are used to make different operations.
The same Operate() function can be used from the Operation interface to do both addition and subtraction, while the same Operate() function in the abstract class
can be used to both square a number and take its square root. We also had two abstract classes, so I changed one of them to an interface to show that we can use both
common interfaces.
