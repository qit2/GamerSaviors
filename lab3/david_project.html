                This website is a browser game called Google by Association. The name is a play on the phrase “guilty by association.” 
                This browser game uses Google Images to provide six images of a hidden noun that you would have to guess by looking at them. 
                These images are found by searching “a random common adjective” + “the hidden noun.” Both words are taken from json files. 
                The random adjective and an image of the adjective and noun are shown to the player.
