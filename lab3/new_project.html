           This project will develop a gaming-focused web application which uses user interest to suggest new games to purchase. 
           When the user opens our website they will be prompted to either register or sign in. 
           A user without a registered account will not be able to use the website. 
           This will make it so that we can keep track of what the user looks at on the website and be able to give them a better prediction of the games they might like. 
           For instance we can add a section that recommends games based on the previous games they have bought while on the website. 
           This will be similar to how Netflix sets up their app. 
           In addition to this we will have a detailed search for users to find specific types of games. 
           We will ask the user questions like, the region they are in, what rating they want (E, E10, T, or M), what price range, 
           what console they choose to play on, whether they want single player or multiplayer games, 
           whether they are looking for cross platform games where users can play with PC players if they are on a console, and what genre of game(s) they want. 
           These are just a few of the questions the user will be prompted with, 
           which will help narrow down the selection of games and make it easier for a user to find a new game that they would enjoy. 
           Once the search is complete, there will be a list of games that match the descriptions where users can give from highest ranking to lowest ranking titles. 
           When the user looks through the list and finds an interesting title, all they would have to do is click on the game and it will open to a page all about that game. 
           This will be similar to how Steam sets up their game descriptions. It will have videos and pictures, reviews and descriptions of the game. 
           On top of that there will be a thread on every games page where users can give commentary or recommend other games saying things like, 
           “If you enjoyed this game I would recommend Rocket League.”, You can also add friends who have similar game interests, 
           and an implemented friend list can help you get teammates. Our website will also include a price matching tool. 
           The users can pick the console of their choice and the website will compare prices with multiple different websites like Amazon, Gamestop, Walmart, and Target to find the best price for the game. 
           If it is available digitally on PC, then it will also look through popular sites like GOG.com or indiegala.com to find sales Steam may not have. 
           This will save the user time and effort looking at multiple websites just to save a few dollars whereas our website will be able to do the search in seconds. 
           Additionally, under any game description, links towards streamers who host special events, 
           which will only be hosted by our website will be displayed so more gamers can be attracted to our web program.
