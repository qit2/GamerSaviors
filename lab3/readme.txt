David Finck:

My markup is semantically correct on my resume because each tag that I use has a reason for being there and it makes sense to the place where I put it.
I did not just use div tags everywhere in my code. For thhe top section I used a header tag because I was the header of my resume page which had my name and
my personal information. After that I used an article tag to be around all of my main information like education, projects, and work experience. I then used an
aside tag for all of the little information like related courses and skills. I put the aside tag because this inifoormation was just a side thing and wasn't
meant to be the main focus. Inside these tags I kept a similar style that repeated for each section so I reuse the same tags a few times. The tags I reused were
the section tag, the ul and li tags, and the h2 tag. The h2 tag I used as the header of each individual section in my resume. Then I used section tags along
with the bootstrap classes and I chose section tag because it breaks up the text in sections by columns so it made sence to me to use the section tags. Then
when adding information I mainly used ul and li because I wanted the information to be in a list format.

For this project I was able to get away without using div or span tags for styling purposes. I did use a strong tag and if I wanted the style to be something
different than just being bold I would have used a span tag in replace of the strong tag in this section but all I wanted was for the word to be bold.

The hCard information that was added is helpful to both humans and computers because the information that is being markedup is very presice. So the tags that
are used are used for specific information. HCard provides tags that are specifically meant for personal iniformation like address and name which helps make the code
easy to read by both humans and computers.
